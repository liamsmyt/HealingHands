              <h6>Sitting down could be the new smoking</h6>
              <p>
                Scientists have revealed a new epidemic – sitting disease. Our
                sedentary lifestyles are so bad for us that sitting down could
                be as bad for us as smoking. Studies show that sitting down – as
                most of us do for work and leisure – is affecting our long-term
                health. Irish people spend approximately 6 hours sitting while
                working at their desks, watching TV or driving. People are
                unaware that this (regardless of adopting a healthy diet) is
                driving up your blood pressure and leaving you at risk of
                developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular problems, depression,
                obesity and some types of cancers.
              </p>
              <h6>Sitting increases your chance of premature death</h6>
              <p>
                A study examining mortality in women revealed that those who
                were inactive or sitting for more than 6 hours a day are 94%
                more likely to die prematurely. For men, the very same inactive
                lifestyle increases their risk of cardiovascular mortality by
                84%.
              </p>
              <h6>Exercise alone may not be the answer</h6>
              <p>
                The bad news is that though you may exercise regularly, this
                doesn’t rectify the damage that sitting is doing to your
                physique.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may be suffering from sitting disease without even knowing
                it. Have you felt cramps or niggles in your back, shoulder or
                neck area? Have you put them down to sleeping funny? Don’t be
                complacent and accept chronic pain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, make a pledge to do these four things every day. Make
                them part of your daily routine as much as your cuppa when you
                arrive at work.
              </p>
              <h6>4 things you should be doing everyday</h6>
              <p>
                Get into the habit of doing certain tasks standing up, like
                making calls, checking your notifications, opening your post
              </p>
              <p>
                Stand up and stretch for a few minutes every 20 minutes and if
                you need reminding set an alarm on your phone. You can even
                programme your computer mouse to alert you every 20 minutes.
                Stand up straight, stretch out fully, breathe deeply for 30
                seconds or a minute. Take a walk. Basically move! If you work
                from home, or in your own office, you can do some lunges to
                really shake off that chair posture!
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternate between standing and sitting at your desk. Why? After
                twenty minutes of sitting at a desk your ligaments and soft
                tissues start to deform having been in the same position for too
                long. Your body takes on a permanent chair-like shape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Be personal and rather than sending an email to a colleague in
                the same office or even building, walk over to them, providing
                your work related news or updates. It not only enables you to
                escape from your desk for two minutes but your lines of
                communication are better as a result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Follow suit at home and instead of watching TV (sitting again!)
                take up an active hobby like swimming, walking, or running or
                organise a game in the park – get the family involved. Find
                energetic ways to occupy family time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make changes towards being more active by walking up the stairs
                instead of taking the lift. Get off the bus at an earlier stop
                or park your car away from the office, forcing you to power walk
                to work. Instead of sitting around a table for an informal
                meeting, suggest a walk-and-talk, or have a stand-up meeting.
                They are much more efficient as people don’t waste time – they
                get straight to the point!
              </p>
              <h6>Here are some initiatives you could suggest at work:</h6>
              <p>
                Consider purchasing or making a stand-up desk. Ask your office
                manager if a couple of stand-up desks can be installed in the
                office for anyone to use if they are reading something, taking
                notes during a call, stuffing envelopes, or whatever
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider purchasing or making a stand-up desk. Ask your office
                manager if a couple of stand-up desks can be installed in the

                notes during a call, stuffing envelopes, or whatever
              </p>
              <p>
                Suggest an active initiative where the staff support each other
                in promoting a good sitting/standing working balance. A group
                approach will increase participation and make it easier to form
                habits, plus, if everyone is doing lunges, you won’t feel like
                an oddball!
              </p>
              <p>
                Get a work-place assessment. An expert on posture will come in
                and assess your work set-up, making recommendations which should
                improve your well being. If you are in the Leinster area, I can
                do this.
              </p>
              <h6>Therapies that can help</h6>
              <p>
                If you are already experiencing chronic aches or pains, a
                regular Swedish massage, deep tissue massage/medical massage or
                sports massage will help undo knots and promote healing but you
                really need to change your work practices to see a long-term
                improvement. Dry needling can be effective for shoulder or back
                pain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflexology is an incredible treatment, which promotes
                homeostasis – the physiological equilibrium between
                interdependent elements – by working on the feet. It encourages
                the person’s own healing systems to be activated to maintain
                well being and it has the added bonus of being incredibly
                relaxing.
