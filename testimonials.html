                    Hands for several years now but only recently experienced
                    Bernadette’s Sound Therapy. It was so relaxing and I felt
                    the benefit of it days later. I always experience renewed
                    energy levels after a reflexology session but with added
                    sound therapy too I feel so much lighter, less stiff, and
                    less stressed. I would highly recommend Bernadette for any
                    of her vast array of treatments. All the treatments, the
                    environment, and Bernadette herself, both as a person and a
                    professional, are so tranquil, warm, and welcoming."

                    attending Bernadette’s Sound Therapy session. I am very in
                    tune with holistic therapies and regularly for reflexology
                    but I have to admit I was still sceptical as to how I would
                    benefit from the sound therapy. In my hectic and fast paced
                    life, I find it extremely difficult to relax but I found the
                    sound therapy very powerful and it had a profound effect on
                    my mind and body. The sound therapy coupled with the
                    reflexology treatment was amazing and I could not rate
                    either treatment high enough. A word of warning, in relation
                    to the Sound Therapy it’s essential to approach the
                    experience with an open mind and a willingness to let go of
                    any preconceived notions or expectations. The benefits and
                    the effects of a wellbeing are worth it. I have signed up
                    for a course as I think it will really help me reduce my
                    stress levels." "

                    and reflexology. The sound therapy is really incredible, it
                    brings you to a place of deep deep relaxation it’s not like
                    anything else I’ve experienced and after the treatment, I’ve
                    found myself to feel more grounded, eneergized, sleep has
                    improved greatly, The reflexology is another incredible
                    treatment, this promotes healing through massage of pressure
                    points in your feet. Since doing this treatment I’ve a lot
                    of my menopausal symptoms have improved including less
                    headaches, joint pain and have a general feeling of
                    well-being that I haven’t had in years. I have also received
                    deep tissue massage for migraines/headaches and for muscle
                    aches and pains from Bernadette. If you are looking for
                    someone in the Kildare area I could not recommend Bernadette
                    more, she is a natural healer and her clinic is always
                    spotlessly clean warm and welcoming."

                    going to her since! Throughout all that time I have been
                    able to re-boot my energy levels and train of thought with
                    it. Having a family, running a very busy business and
                    looking after everyone naturally brings its stress and
                    strain to the body both mentally and physically. I cannot
                    express how beneficial her reflexology has been for me and I
                    recently had the chance to try sound bath with Bernadette
                    and could not get over how much energy I had after it. I
                    always know when I need to go for reflexology as my body
                    will tell me and without fail Bernadette always delivers in
