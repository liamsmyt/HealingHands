                      " I first availed of Bernadette’s treatments when seeking a tension release treatment on my back. From the first session, Bernadette’s experience and expertise were clearly evident. I availed of a few sessions and felt such a sense of relief and a release after the treatments.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                       
I began Reflexology with Bernadette just before I became pregnant. The treatments were highly beneficial to rebalance my body to prepare for pregnancy. Throughout my pregnancy, I attended
                      Reflexology most months. I quickly realised that the Reflexology sessions were not just a “treat” where I could relax, unwind and rest for an hour.
                      They were very much needed for me and my growing baby. I could feel the amazing benefits after each session- better sleep, improved digestion and a relaxed mind.
                     </p>
                    <p>
I returned to Reflexology a few months after having my baby. Bernadette was amazing in helping my postpartum body recover and worked on the areas that she felt needed help. After one of the Reflexology sessions, Bernadette highlighted a medical issue that she thought I had. I hadn’t been feeling well for a while and I had not shared this with her as I thought my issues might be related to postpartum recovery. I sought medical advice from a doctor and after a few tests, I discovered that Bernadette was correct in what she brought to my attention. I am so grateful and thankful to Bernadette for highlighting that health concern.
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      
Bernadette is a kind, caring, knowledgeable and highly trained professional. I feel a sense of calm come over me when I walk into her treatment room and I know that I am in safe and healing hands."

Recently I started incorporating Bernadette’s Sound Therapy into my Reflexology sessions, I had never tried Sound Therapy before and I would highly recommend. It works so well with reflexology, after my second session I experienced a huge release of emotions and found some clarity I had been looking for in certain areas of my life!"

                    Hands for several years now but only recently experienced
                    Bernadette’s Sound Therapy. It was so relaxing and I felt
                    the benefit of it days later. I always experience renewed
                    energy levels after a reflexology session but with added
                    sound therapy too I feel so much lighter, less stiff, and
                    less stressed. I would highly recommend Bernadette for any
                    of her vast array of treatments. All the treatments, the
                    environment, and Bernadette herself, both as a person and a

                    ""I was surprised at how relaxed and zen I felt after
                    attending Bernadette’s Sound Therapy session. I am very in
                    tune with holistic therapies and regularly for reflexology
                    but I have to admit I was still sceptical as to how I would
                    benefit from the sound therapy. In my hectic and fast paced
                    life, I find it extremely difficult to relax but I found the
                    sound therapy very powerful and it had a profound effect on
                    my mind and body. The sound therapy coupled with the
                    reflexology treatment was amazing and I could not rate
                    either treatment high enough. A word of warning, in relation
                    to the Sound Therapy it’s essential to approach the
                    experience with an open mind and a willingness to let go of
                    any preconceived notions or expectations. The benefits and
                    the effects of a wellbeing are worth it. I have signed up
                    for a course as I think it will really help me reduce my

                    and reflexology. The sound therapy is really incredible, it
                    brings you to a place of deep deep relaxation it’s not like
                    anything else I’ve experienced and after the treatment, I’ve
                    found myself to feel more grounded, eneergized, sleep has
                    improved greatly, The reflexology is another incredible
                    treatment, this promotes healing through massage of pressure
                    points in your feet. Since doing this treatment I’ve a lot
                    of my menopausal symptoms have improved including less
                    headaches, joint pain and have a general feeling of
                    well-being that I haven’t had in years. I have also received
                    deep tissue massage for migraines/headaches and for muscle
                    aches and pains from Bernadette. If you are looking for
                    someone in the Kildare area I could not recommend Bernadette
                    more, she is a natural healer and her clinic is always

                    ""I first went to Bernadette for reflexology when I was
                    expecting my first child – that was 24 years ago have been
                    going to her since! Throughout all that time I have been
                    able to re-boot my energy levels and train of thought with
                    it. Having a family, running a very busy business and
                    looking after everyone naturally brings its stress and
                    strain to the body both mentally and physically. I cannot
                    express how beneficial her reflexology has been for me and I
                    recently had the chance to try sound bath with Bernadette
                    and could not get over how much energy I had after it. I
                    always know when I need to go for reflexology as my body
                    will tell me and without fail Bernadette always delivers in
                    the most professional and relaxed manner.""

                    person. I have always focused on personal development and
                    achieving my goals. I had heard about sound therapy for a
                    long time but never had the opportunity to try this therapy
                    until my good friend Bernadette Doyle, Healing hands health
                    and wellness clinic, Newbridge started practicing this
                    therapy. I decided to give it a try and my expectations
                    exceeded everything. First of all, I almost immediately fell
                    into a state of deep relaxation, which made me feel blissful
                    and soothed. I didn't think about my problems, I just moved
                    into a world full of beautiful experiences. The music ran
                    through my whole body and it helped me follow my inner
                    voice. I felt amazing to the point that at one end I shed a
                    tear of happiness because what I saw with my inner eyes was
                    amazing and real. After this experience, I felt really
                    stronger and full of energy to meet my challenges and follow
                    my dreams. Almost immediately, because on the second day
                    after my second visit, everything began to change and so did
                    my family change as well! It's like magic! Every day we
                    struggle with more and more difficult situations and it
                    seems impossible to completely cut off ourselves from
                    everyday life. Moments like that are so crucial. Such sound
                    therapy is like moving into a different world, the one we
                    want to exist on a daily basis. I wholeheartedly recommend
                    it to anyone looking for more meaningful things that can
                    help in our lives. All the best to everyone."

                    Bernadette and my only regret is that I didn't start sooner.
                    Reflexology helped me both physically and emotionally. The
                    treatments were extremely relaxing and I always felt like a
                    new person after them. I felt more empowered and prepared
                    for my labour as a result of the sessions and considered
                    them an essential part of my labour preparation. I'm sure
                    many people may be apprehensive of attending a 1:1 session
                    when pregnant but I was immediately put at ease by
                    Bernadette's strict COVID protocols (including pre-screening
                    and temperature checks). Postpartum, the sessions rebalanced
                    me and assisted with decreasing my fluid retention. I would
                    recommend Bernadette to everyone but if you are pregnant,

                    to see many physiotherapists to help me get back to work
                    pain free but was to be disappointed by the lack of results
                    especially because my back strength and mobility suffered so
                    much and no one seem to be able to help me. Then my sister
                    recommended I go see Bernadette and try reflexology to see
                    if it might help. If I am honest I had doubts about how this
                    could help me but I was willing to try anything and I am now
                    very grateful I did go. The first thing I noticed after the
                    hour long session of complete relaxation was how incredibly
                    stressed I was before the session, I felt like a ton of
                    weights had been lifted from my shoulders and then after a
                    couple of days the physical benefits became very evident.
                    Not only was my back pain greatly reduced but I had regained
                    a lot of mobility and strength in my back which has only
                    increased with each session. Even without the physical
                    benefits the reflexology session is worth it alone just for
                    the stress relief that it gives and relaxation that takes
                    over during the session. I highly recommend Bernadette, she
                    is completely professional and makes you feel completely at
                    ease as she asks about your medical problems. Healing hands
                    could not be a better name for her business and I will be

                    was gone & I was more free to move my shoulder – dressing,
                    driving, even walking was painful but thankfully now it's
                    getting back to normal. I plan on having the same treatment
                    again in a few week's time. I would highly recommend
                    Bernadette for her expertise & knowledge. She can adapt any
                    treatment to suit the person & the ailment. And is happy to

                    Bernadette back in December for pregnancy reflexology I was
                    a wreck both physically and mentally. From just working on
                    my feet she could tell what was happening in my body and
                    mind. She could take away all physical pain and clear my
                    mind ( which sometimes I felt she could read) . She could
                    alter each treatment to concentrate and conquer on the
                    particular ailment on each visit.. Fast forward to now and I
                    am currently nursing my 3 day old baby as I write this.
                    Bernadette could tell me when the baby would be born and
                    reassure me about the labour etc.. Again she was right. I

I am an 82 year old female suffering from "restless leg syndrome" and decided to try Reflexology. I have found Bernadette very helpful and knowledgeable. She is very quick to put patients at ease. Her clinic is very clean and has all facilities i.e. toilets and shower. Her treatment rooms and reception are very tastefully decorated and a pleasant environment in which to have your treatments. She at no time makes you feel you are under pressure to make return appointments. After my initial visit Bernadette contacted me to check I was Ok after it and reassure me.

We often use her vouchers as Birthday and Christmas presents (always brings a smile to the face of the recipient). Reflexology and deep tissue massage are the therapies we use most. The latter is particularly beneficial to me, I sit at a desk for many hours each day so my back can become quite stiff. However it really loosens up incredibly well after a massage session. Service is always excellent, just last week I bought a present of a voucher (through hhandsclinic.ie) at 10pm the night before my daughters birthday.

I found them very relaxing, especially since Bernadette insists on not speaking during the session so you can really benefit from them. I found they helped with my stress levels coming up to the end of my time in work. My back was sore from sitting at my desk and training in my replacement and I found the reflexology helped with that too. I believe it also helped with my labour. Th time from breaking my waters to induction and delivery only took 3 & 1/4 hours. I had a very straightforward delivery with only gas and air and my recovery has been quick. I did skin to skin straight after delivery and was able to breastfeed my baby within an hour of labour. This meant I am still breastfeeding 6 weeks on. I would definitely get reflexology if I were to become pregnant again."

      ""Approx 16 years ago, I decided to finally tackle a long-term problem with my neck and shoulders. Almost all my life, I have suffered with pain and stiffness in neck and shoulders due mainly to my occupation which involved long periods sitting at a desk with poor posture. I was reasonably active and tried various exercise regimes to counteract this occupational hazard. Most remedies worked for a while but the problem persisted. My sister had been to Bernadette for reflexology and suggested that it might be worth a try. On my first appointment, Bernadette conducted a very in-depth consultation after which she recommended a course of massage followed by several reflexology treatments. I couldn’t believe the improvement after the first few sessions. What impressed me most was that, in addition to the significant improvement in the physical problems, my stress levels were vastly reduced due to the relaxation benefits of the reflexology. Over the intervening years, I have continued attending Bernadette for reflexology on an ongoing basis, mainly for relaxation and stress reduction. Occasionally, the neck and shoulder pain flares up and she changes the routine to massage for a time and then back to the reflexology. I find that the combination therapy works really well for me. Personally, I have absolutely no doubt as to the general health benefits of reflexology therapy. In my opinion Bernadette is the most caring and professional practitioner I have encountered, and I have no hesitation in recommending her to anyone.""

If I had a tightness or a small niggle Bernadette would rub it out. When I completed Galway I came away injury free and very strong. I trained for my first marathon in Dublin and again Bernadette did great work, I ran and completed the marathon injury free. In 2012 I trained for Ironman Frankfurt and kept up my massage with Bernadette to sort any tightness or pain I had in my legs and shoulders. I completed Ironman Frankfurt and didn't have any aches or pains after it. I went back to Bernadette for a full massage after I got home and felt in really good shape. I went on to complete another Dublin marathon injury free. 2013 I went on then to take part in my first ultra marathon in Connemara and continued with my visits to Bernadette while training. I took part in 3 marathons & 2 triathlons all with the help of Bernadette. I can highly recommend Bernadette for massage and advice on staying injury free."

      "Bernadette Doyle has been attending our residents here in Ashley Lodge Nursing Home for the past 6 years. Our residents look forward to her visits each week where she does both one on one sessions with some and group sessions with others according to their individual needs. The feedback has been extremely satisfactory and a thoroughly enjoyable experience each time. Bernadette is a gentle and patient person with a kind word and an open ear for all. She is a very dedicated lady and I recommend her Complementary therapies to anyone who requires them."

      "I have attended Bernadette for both Reflexology and Pregnancy Reflexology. I have found Bernadette to be highly skilled and very professional. I attended Bernadette for Pregnancy Reflexology from 6 weeks to 40 weeks. I found Reflexology during my pregnancy very beneficial, it help greatly with my severe morning sickness and also with my stress levels as I am self employed and am constantly on the go. The pregnancy Reflexology sessions gave me an opportunity to relax and bond with my baby. I also attended Bernadette for post natal Reflexology and found it to be very beneficial for helping re-balance my hormones and helping with the stress of a newborn. I would highly recommend Bernadette for both Reflexology and Pregnancy Reflexology."

      "My 17 month old daughter has trouble managing her emotions, self soothing and has numerous tantrums daily not to mention the high level of energy and the fact she does not need to nap. After trying every routine and approach out there with nothing working I decided to contact Bernadette at healing hands for reflexology, not sure what to expect but knowing there is no quick fix we attended an appointment. Bernadette was friendly and the atmosphere in the room was so calming my baby feel asleep almost as soon as we walked through the door. She slept soundly the entire 40 minutes of treatment which was a shock in itself. The following morning is when we really noticed the change. My baby was so calm and content in herself and in her own company, the change in her behavior was so noticeable it was almost unbelievable. I would highly recommend Bernadette for reflexology she has an amazing way of putting your anxiety at ease and making even young children feel relaxed in her company."

      "I have been attending Bernadette for the past year as she has been helping me with issues related to my arthritis. She listens in detail to what the problem is and works her magic to solve it. Thankfully I have never left where an improvement was not felt. When treating, she explains what she believes is happening and what may cause the issue. This makes the sessions interesting and informative. Bernadette is bubbly and charismatic and has a 'mind full of knowledge' that she is eager to share. She is professional and it is evident that she has a huge passion for the human body and the work that she carries out. I needed her assistance recently and having three autoimmune conditions I was very apprehensive about leaving the safety of my home due to COVID. Bernadette reassured me that she is following all safety regulations and when I arrived, I never felt safer. She spoke to me about what she did in advance of my arrival and during my treatment. This made me feel safe. She also ensures that there is time between appointments to sanitize and to avoid her clients crossing paths. She has thought of everything. I can confirm that she is practising in a safe manner. I would highly recommend attending her practise as she is exceptional at what she does."
