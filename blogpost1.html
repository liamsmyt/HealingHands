              <p>
                It feels like women are finding it harder to conceive these
                days. I am certainly seeing a lot more clients coming to me with
                this frustrating and emotionally draining issue. I’m not sure
                exactly why that is. I read recently that Irish women are the
                oldest first-time mothers in Europe at nearly 29 years old and
                that we have the highest proportion of first-time mums in their
                40s. From our mid-30s onwards, the quality of our eggs is in
                sharp decline.
              </p>

              <p>
                Of course difficulty conceiving can be an issue for women of any
                age and there are lots of other factors.
              </p>
              <p>
                I feel that the stressful and hectic lives we live today must be
                having some kind of impact. Stress is certainly a block to the
                way that our internal energy flows through the body. It doesn’t
                take a huge leap to see that blocked or stagnant energy flows
                may well be making conception more difficult.
              </p>

              <p>
                That’s why I am an advocate of complementary therapies.
                Reflexology in particular is all about rebalancing the body’s
                internal energy.
              </p>

              <h6 class="my-3">
                Reflexology is an incredible treatment, which promotes
                homeostasis – the physiological equilibrium between
                interdependent elements – by working on the feet.
              </h6>

              <div class="purple-text mt-4 mb-1">A chance to reset</div>

              <p>
                At its most basic, a reflexology session is a chance to close
                the doors on life for an hour, to rest and switch off. We rarely
                switch off completely these days. The therapy room is a place of
                refuge. By having a therapy we are giving the body the space and
                time to find its own internal harmony again. Then add a
                nurturing treatment like reflexology and the body has a chance
                to reset itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might feel energised, able to see things clearly, relaxed
                and unburdened. When trying to conceive is all you think about,
                this feeling post-reflexology is really valuable. Occasionally,
                people feel nauseous, anxious or tearful, but this is only
                temporary and is considered to be part of the healing process.
                To get the most out of your treatment you should try to take it
                easy afterwards and drink plenty of water, which helps flush out
                toxins.
              </p>
              <p>
                And (thinking positively) when you do get pregnant, reflexology
                eases many of the uncomfortable side effects of pregnancy. In my
                experience, clients of mine who have had reflexology during
                pregnancy have easier births with quicker recovery, and their
                babies tend to be more placid than those who don’t. It is also
                helpful after the birth of your child, easing post-partum
                depression, anxiety, urination and bowel movements.
