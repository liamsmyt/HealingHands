            <h3>What is Lymphatic Drainage?</h3>
            <p>
              Lymphatic drainage massage is a slow, rhythmic massage, which
              follows the path of the lymphatic system of the body. It helps to
              eliminate waste more efficiently, reduces swelling and helps to
              improve skin texture.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Lymph?</h3>
            <p>
              Lymph is a clear, yellowish fluid that flows around the body in a
              separate system to the blood circulation system. Lymph is
              essential to your immune system and helps to fight infection in
              that it carries white blood cells and antibodies to your tissues
              and organs but it also hoovers up excess fats, bacteria, dead
              cells, viruses and more, keeping your body free of toxins. So,
              your lymphatic system keeps the toxins flushed out of the body and
              keeps your immune system working properly.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflexology Lymph Drainage(RLD)</h3>
            <p>
              Reflexology Lymph Drainage (RLD) is a specific reflexology
              technique which focuses on stimulating the lymphatic reflexes on
              the feet. As the feet mirror the body, the full lymphatic system
              can be stimulated thus causing a very noticeable effect of the
              lymph/fluid in the body. It is a unique sequence that has been
              researched and developed by Sally Kay BSc (Hons), when she was
              working in cancer care. I had the pleasure of completing one of
              her courses this year June, 2020.

              Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in
              Ireland (excluding skin cancer). Most women diagnosed with breast
              cancer are over 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer.
              About 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their
              lifetime. There’s a good chance of recovery if it is detected in
              its early stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              LYMPHEDEMA, is defined as tissue swelling due to the failure of
              lymph drainage and generally occurs in one or both arms and or
              legs. It is most commonly caused by the removal of or damage to
              lymph nodes as a part of cancer treatment. After breast cancer a
              person may experience psychological or emotional difficulties due
              to altered body image, and a swollen limb can exacerbate this.
              Research suggests that survivors with lymphedema are more likely
              to suffer psychological and emotional difficulties, be more
              disabled, and experience a poorer quality of life than survivors
              without the condition. Improved breast cancer survival rates
              suggest that approximately 2:3 women survive the disease beyond 20
              years. This means that more people are living longer with this
              debilitating side effect for which there is currently no cure.

              Massage Lymph Drainage (MLD), and Reflexology Lymph Drainage (RLD)
              can help to assist in the removal of excess fluid build-up as in
              the case of Lymphedema but can also be used in the treatment of
              the following:

              I have noticed an increase in the need/request for lymph drainage
              post cosmetic surgery of which I have seen great results in
              assisting the lymphatic drainage return to normal flow and
              function. Pregnancy related oedema (great results over the years
              during pregnancy).

              Having over 23 years’ experience in dealing with cancer
              reflexology, fertility, pregnancy and general reflexology on a
              clinical level, RLD is an added advantage with a general treatment
              or as a standalone treatment and each treatment can be tailored to
              suit your needs.
